## Last Week's Accomplishments

-The Unity program will now record username and password in a database. [If the username entered is not in the database, then a new username is created.]
-If you enter the wrong password corresponding with an established username, then the application will 'force close' only for the client that failed login. This makes it so that you have to run the .exe again to try to login again. 
-This all can function over a continuous server running on the virtual machine that ideally anyone can access at anytime.

## This Week's Plan

FIGURE OUT HOW TO RECORD DATA WHEN PLAYERS LOG OFF!!!!!!!! -> "Star Rank/ Gem Cut"

Save the position of players as they logout so next time they boot up the game, they spawn at those coordinates. This will imply that I can save more data that changes during the gameplay like "ELO"-Rankings.

## Anything Blocking?
Not yet.
