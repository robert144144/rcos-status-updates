## Last Week's Accomplishments

-Drew a small drawing of the bug in the 'hash table' like structure for creating lobbies.
-Finished creating the 'hash table' like lobby creation procedure. -- Turns out, you don't need to automate the deallocation of the lobbies; Even if, like 2000 lobbies get spawned and clog up memory, then a human can just shut down the server for like 20 minutes and manually reset this hashing thing so that it restarts back to 0. This might be a problem to address later, but the deallocation of lobbies is not something to worry about.

## This Week's Plan

-Assign the character selection algorithm to my teammates. 
-Look for options for hosting the server. [I mean, even if I weren't to implement anything else and just host the server... then technically, I met my goal.]
	> The goal simply was to make an MMO, the rest of the concepts in the proposal can be subjective as they exist slightly on the 'art' spectrum.
-Have a concise document recording mechanics of this game world, and perhaps begin to implement them once I know that I can get the server is up.

## Anything Blocking?

Not yet. Will be looking for cloud server hosting soon... Did get 100$ in Google Cloud credits!

## Notes

Attached Image of a attempted representation of the 'hash-like' data structure. This was a bug like 3 days ago, it is no longer a relevant bug, but it does give insight on the structure of this system.
