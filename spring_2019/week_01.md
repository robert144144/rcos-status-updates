## Last Week's Accomplishments

Drew out data structure for future milestones and goals.
Figured out how to send clients to different Scenes properly, if they already exist in memory. Hub -> Lobby.

## This Week's Plan

Attempt to make it so the number of lobbies is equal to the number of active games. Currently, I am assuming that there is a limit of 100 games and just putting the clients into those. 
This new implementation will also make it easier to end games and it will save memory space.

## Anything Blocking?

Not yet.

## Notes
