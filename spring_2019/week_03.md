## Last Week's Accomplishments

-Attended Google Cloud Computing lecture. Got an idea from it: Use Google Cloud Virtual Machine as a continuous server... I got 200$ in free credit.
-Teammate(s) downloaded Blender and are working on 3D modeling.
-The Google Cloud Virtual Machine is running the game, however, it seems to be 'lagging' a lot. I cannot test yet if people can connect to it from anywhere.

## This Week's Plan
-Figure out more about this Google Cloud Virtual Machine as a continuous server and how things will work with it. 
-If that is complete, then I will continue to think about core aspects of "MMOs" and what might be in the 'first draft' design document.

## Anything Blocking?

Not yet.
