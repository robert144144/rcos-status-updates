## Last Week's Accomplishments

-Figured out that the Virtual Machine Server was crashing because I was trying to play sounds on the virtual machine through ChucK. Removing all the sound related scripts fixed the problem. 
-Made a google Drive so that if I want to test the game on other people's computers, they can download it easily.
-I believe the "MMO" part works now, on to saving and loading


DOWNLOAD THE EXE TO CONNECT TO THE GAME SERVER HERE [mostly a reminder for myself]:

## This Week's Plan

-FIGURE OUT HOW TO SAVE DATA? 
- Ideas:
	-login system with password so that the client sends the password to the server and the server attaches that password to a player character.
	

## Anything Blocking?
Not yet. Probably something to do with server hosting solutions will come up again... Like max concurrent players...
