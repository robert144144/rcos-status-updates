## Last Week's Accomplishments

-The Unity program will now write to a text file the usernames that get input on the menu.
-The Unity program will read the text file to make sure that the usernames being written are unique.
For example: robert123123 cannot appear twice in this file, this makes a table where I can look up and record the stats of clients logging on and off. 

## This Week's Plan

-Have the client's username get sent to the file. Return data corresponding to that username's information. [Position, Character, Rank]	
-Perhaps implement a Password system           Ideal file structure [USERNAME PASSWORD (X,Y,Z) CHARACTER RANK\n etc.]

## Anything Blocking?
Not yet. Probably something to do with server hosting solutions will come up again... Like max concurrent players...?
