## Last Week's Accomplishments

-Click "LAN Server Only" - TO RUN THE SERVER HEADLESSLY, and not as a 'mirror' that is both client and server
-The client computer was able to connect to the server computer that ran the 'larger MMO' game. However the connection caused the game to go "Not Responding"
-The simpler "Sphere MMO" could hold about 3 players controlling the rotation of spheres remotely before experiencing noticable slowdown.

-Server hosting sites were investigated: Photon Bolt, AWS, IBM servers. None will be used unless one is definitely needed. 
-C# profiler found in case it needs to be used: http://www.semdesigns.com/Products/Profilers/CSharpProfiler.html

## This Week's Plan

-Basically, compare spheretest.exe with d.exe and keep guessing through trial and error which scripts might be causing the crash. (When the client connects to the larger "MMO", it goes "Not Responding")

## Anything Blocking?
Not sure yet. Probably something to do with server hosting solutions will come up again.
